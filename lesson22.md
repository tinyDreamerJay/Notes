[^1] Some plays are so successful that they are played on end.  
[^2] It is so poor actors as this, for they had to repeat the same lines night after night.  
[^3] One expects that actors would remember the lines by heart and must not be falter.  
[^4] However, this is not always the case.  
[^5] An actor was cast a aristocrat in a quite successful play and the noble had been imprisioned for twenty years in Bastille.  
[^6] In the last preformance of play, the gaoler went on the stage, handing with a letter and gave the letter to the aristocrat.  
[^7] Though the aristocrat had to read the letter in every performance, he insisted that the letter should be written on full.  
[^8] One night, the gaoler decided to play a joke on his colleage to find out if, after so many performances, he remerbered the content of the letter by heart.  
[^9] The curtain went on and the last performance beginned.  
[^10] When the noble sitting alone behind bars of the dim cell, the gaoler went up to stage, handing with the letter.  
[^11] The gaoler walked into the cell and handed the letter to the aristocrat. However, the gaoler did not give the letter written on full to the him as usual. It was a blank paper.  
[^12] The gaoler stared at him eargerly, knowing whether his colleage remembered the parts by heart or not.  
[^13] The noble stared at the paper for a few seconds, and 眼珠一幢 said "The light in the cell is dim.Please reading the letter to me."  
[^14] The gaoler found that he did not remember any word in the letter and he said"The light is surely dim.I need to a take glasses."  
[^15] He hurried off the stage.What made the aristocrat laughing is that the gaoler brought a pair of glasses and the letter which they used usually and he readed it for the gaoler.

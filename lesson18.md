 [[Unit 1]]

   Standard text:
    Modern sculpture rarely surprises us any more.The idea that modern art can only be seen in museums is mistaken. Even people who take no interest in art cannot have failed to notice examples of modern sculpture on display in public places. Strange forms stand in gardens, and outside buildings and shops. We have got quite used to them. Some so-called 'modern' pieces have been on display for nearly eighty years.
    In spite of this, some people -- including myself -- were surprise by a recent exhibition of modern sculpture. The first thing I saw when I entered the art gallery was a notice which said: 'Do not touch the exhibits. Some of them are dangerous!' The objects on display were pieces of moving sculpture. Oddly shaped forms that are suspended form the ceiling and move in response to a gust of wind are quite familiar to everybody. These objects, however, were different. Lined up against the wall, there were long thin wires attached to metal spheres. The spheres had been magnetized and attracted or repelled each other all the time. In the centre of the hall, there were a number of tall structures which contained coloured lights. These lights flickered continuously like traffic lights which have gone mad. Sparks were emitted from small black boxes and red lamps flashed on and off angrily. It was rather like an exhibition of prehistoric electronic equipment. These peculiar forms not only seemed designed to shock people emotionally, but to give them.
    现代雕塑不再使我们感到惊讶了。那种认为现代艺术只能在博物馆里才能看到的观点是错误的。即使是对艺术不感兴趣的人也不会注意不到在公共场所展示的现代艺术品。公园里、大楼和商店外竖立着的奇形怪状的雕塑，对这些，我们已经司空见惯了。有些所谓的“现代”艺术品在那里已经陈列了近80年了。
    尽管如此，最近举办的一次现代雕塑展览还是使一些人（包括我在内）大吃了一惊。走进展厅首先看到的是一张告示，上面写着“切勿触摸展品，某些展品有危险！”展品都是些活动的雕像。人们所熟悉的是悬挂在天花板上、造型奇特、随风飘荡的雕塑品。这些展品却使人大开眼界。靠墙排列着许多细长的电线，而电线又连着金属球。金属球经过磁化，互相之间不停地相互吸引或相互排斥。展厅中央是装有彩色灯泡的许多高高的构件，灯泡一刻不停地闪烁着，就像失去了控制的红绿灯。小黑盒子里迸出火花，红色灯泡发怒似地忽明忽暗。这儿倒像是在展览古老的电子设备。好像设计这些奇形怪状的展品不仅是为了给人感情上的强烈刺激，而且还想给人以电击似的！

[^1]: The idea that modern art can only be seen in museums is mistaken “idea” 比 “opinion” 更自然（“idea” 强调 “观点、看法”，更符合语境）；
[^2]:Even people who take no interest in can not have failed to notice examples of modern sculpture on display in public places
[^3]:  Strange forms stand in gardens,tall buildings and shops.“Strange forms” 直接对应 “奇形怪状的雕塑”
- “gardens” 更侧重带有园艺景观、花草种植的区域，可能是公园的一部分，也可能是独立的小型园林；
- “parks” 则更强调综合性的公共休闲空间，通常包含更大的面积和更多设施（如步道、游乐设施等）。
- “Strange forms” 直接对应 “奇形怪状的雕塑”
- “gardens” 更侧重带有园艺景观、花草种植的区域，可能是公园的一部分，也可能是独立的小型园林；
- “parks” 则更强调综合性的公共休闲空间，通常包含更大的面积和更多设施（如步道、游乐设施等）。
[^4]:We have got quite used to them;
[^5]: Some so-called 'modern' pieces there have been on display for nearly eighty years.
- so-called 被称作 
- “exhibits”（展品）不如 “pieces”（作品）准确（“pieces” 可泛指艺术作品，更符合 “雕塑” 的语境）。
[^6]:In spit of this,some people--including myself--were suprised by a recent exhibition of modern sculpture.
- though 只能接从句,in spit of 是介词 ，可以和名词构成介词短语. 
- “including myself” 本身是介词短语，意为 “包括我自己在内”,在这做插入语
- modern sculpture 代表一个抽象的类属于不可数名词
[^7]:  The first thing I saw when I entered the art gallery was a notice which said 'Do not touch the exhibits.Some of them are dangerous.'
- “The first thing I saw when...” 突出 “首先看到” 的动作；“art gallery” 明确展览地点；“notice” 准确对应 “告示”；定语从句 “which said” 使引语衔接更自然
[^9]: The objects on display were pieces of moving sculpture
[^10]: Oddly shaped forms which suspen from the ceiling and move in response to a gust of wind are quite familiar to everyone.
- “Oddly shaped forms” 精准描述雕塑的形态；“suspended from” 介词正确；“quite familiar to everybody” 更符合 “人们所熟悉的” 的语义，比被动语态 “are known by” 更流畅。
[^11]:These objects were different.
- - 词汇：“exhibits” 重复，原文用 “These objects”（这些物品）指代前文，避免重复；“were different”（有所不同）比 “make people surprised”（让人惊讶）更简洁，且为后文 “大开眼界” 铺垫（先说明 “不同”，再引出 “惊讶”）。
- ###  **object（物体；物品）**

- **核心特点**：指**有明确形态、可触摸的具体物品**，通常强调其 “物理存在性”，且往往暗示该物品有特定用途或能被明确识别。
[^12]:Lined up against the wall,there were many long thin wires attached metal spheres.
[^14]:The metal spheres have been magnetized,they attracted or repelled each other all the time.
[^15]:In the centre of the hall,there were a number of tall structures which contained coloured lights.These lights flickered continuously like traffic light which have gone mad.
[^17]: Sparks were emitted from a small box and the red lamp flashed on and off angrily.
- lamp 灯
[^18]: It was rather like an exhibiton of prehistoric electronic equipment.
- 副词：“rather”（相当，有点）补充程度，使语气更委婉，符合 “倒像是” 的语义。
- “rather” 增强语气；“prehistoric” 精准传达 “古老” 的含义；“exhibition of” 和不可数 “equipment” 符合语法和语义。
[^19]:These peculiar forms not only seemed designed to shock people emotionally,but to give them a electric shock as well !
- seem(to be) done 似乎被怎么样 to be可以省略.
- peculiar adj.奇特的
展厅中央是装有彩色灯泡的许多高高的构件，灯泡一刻不停地闪烁着，就像失去了控制的红绿灯。小黑盒子里迸出火花，红色灯泡发怒似地忽明忽暗。这儿倒像是在展览古老的电子设备。好像设计这些奇形怪状的展品不仅是为了给人感情上的强烈刺激，而且还想给人以电击似的！
